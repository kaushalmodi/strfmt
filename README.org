* Fork
This repo is a *fork* of the original ~strfmt~ repo by *lyro* (Frank
Fisher) at https://bitbucket.org/lyro/strfmt/.

I do not claim any authorship of this awesome project. I forked it
because I am more comfortable with /git/ than /mercurial/ (which is
used for the original repo), and I wanted to make this project work
once again on Nim /devel/ (2018-06-28).
